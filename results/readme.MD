# Results

After training, I obtained some results for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) which show the regions with a high possibility of observing different types of NEOs such as Amors, Apollos, Atiras, and Atens. The results are visualized using contour heat plots and data spread in Aitoff projection.

## Example Plots

Here are some example plots showing the distribution and high-probability regions for observing different types of NEOs:

1. **Amors**:

2. **Apollos**:

3. **Atiras**:

4. **Atens**:

These plots help in understanding the spatial distribution and observation probabilities of various NEO types if the observation was non-biased based on Granvik et. al 2018.
